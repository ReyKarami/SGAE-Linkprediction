# SubGraph AutoEncoder (SGAE): A Framework for Link Prediction
This project introduces SGAE (SubGraph AutoEncoder), a novel framework for link prediction in graphs based on the Graph AutoEncoder (GAE) model. The proposed method enhances the standard GAE by incorporating subgraph extraction and subgraph embedding generation techniques.
